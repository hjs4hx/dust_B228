A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0.

These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.</td><td>2019</td><td>Lupus I is a low-mass star-forming filament currently undergoing a star-forming event. Polarization measurements from optical polarimetry (Franco &amp; Alves 2015) and dust polarization (Matthews et al. 2014) have revealed that the large scale magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly to the main filament axis and that the cloud is magnetically supported. The orientation of the prestellar cores, gravitationally bound objects which are expected to form stars, are found to be often oriented parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, suggesting an influence of the magnetic field on the formation and/or evolution of prestellar cores. We propose a detailed gas kinematics study of one class 0 object and eight prestellar cores: four oriented perpendicular and four parallel to the magnetic field, resolving the major axis of the prestellar core to differentiate between the infall motions along the minor and major core axis, and compare these infall motions with models of ambipolar diffusion.</td><td>PSC_L1-3_a_03_7M</td><td>Busquet, Gemma; Schisano, Eugenio; Merello, Manuel; Pezzuto, Stefano; Elia, Davide; Benedettini, Milena; Cox, Nick; Polychroni, Danae;</td><td>29.020528188095277</td><td>1.4291588403220727</td><td>5.186</td><td>uid://A001/X1284/X2265</td><td>uid://A001/X1284/X2266</td><td>uid://A002/Xcfae6a/X8bf</td><td>How does the large scale magnetic field affect the infall in prestellar cores?</td><td>S</td><td>TARGET</td><td>T</td><td>75.65424659193037</td><td>T</td><td>2019MNRAS.490.1220K</td><td>Low-mass star formation, Pre-stellar cores, Infra-Red Dark Clouds (IRDC)</td><td>ISM and star formation</td><td>2020-12-09T18:39:40.293</td></tr>\n",

The outflow structure is mainly traced by the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 0 and 1), CCH, and CS emissions. These lines also trace the disk/envelope structure around the protostar. The H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 2 and 3), CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;OH, and SO emissions are concentrated toward the protostar, while the DCN emission is more extended around the protostar. We have performed principal component analysis (PCA) for these distributions on two different scales, the outflow and the disk/envelope structure. For the latter case, the molecular-line distributions are classified into two groups, according to the contribution of the second principal component, one having a compact distribution around the protostar and the other showing a rather extended distribution over the envelope. Moreover, the second principal component value tends to increase as an increasing quantum number of H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 0, 1, 2, and 3), reflecting the excitation condition: the distribution is more compact for higher excitation lines. These results indicate that PCA is effective at extracting the characteristic features of the molecular-line distributions around the protostar in an unbiased way. In addition, we identify four blobs in the outflow structure in the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO lines, some of which can also be seen in the CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;OH, CS, CCH, and SO emissions. The gas temperature derived from the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO lines ranges from 43-63 K, which suggests shocks due to the local impact of the outflow on clumps of the ambient gas. We have observed the CCH (N = 3─2, J = 7/2─5/2, F = 4─3 and 3─2) and SO (6&lt;SUB&gt;7&lt;/SUB&gt;─5&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;) emission at a 0.″2 angular resolution toward the low-mass Class 0 protostellar source IRAS 15398─3359 with ALMA. The CCH emission traces the infalling-rotating envelope near the protostar with the outflow cavity extended along the northeast─southwest axis. On the other hand, the SO emission has a compact distribution around the protostar. The CCH emission is relatively weak at the continuum peak position, while the SO emission has a sharp peak there. Although the maximum velocity shift of the CCH emission is about 1 km s&lt;SUP&gt;−1&lt;/SUP&gt; from the systemic velocity, a velocity shift higher than 2 km s&lt;SUP&gt;−1&lt;/SUP&gt; is seen for the SO emission. This high-velocity component is most likely associated with the Keplerian rotation around the protostar. The protostellar mass is estimated to be {0.007}&lt;SUB&gt;-0.003&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;+0.004&lt;/SUP&gt; {M}&lt;SUB&gt;ȯ &lt;/SUB&gt; from the velocity profile of the SO emission. With this protostellar mass, the velocity structure of the CCH emission can be explained by the model of the infalling-rotating envelope, where the radius of the centrifugal barrier is estimated to be 40 au from the comparison with the model. The disk mass evaluated from the dust continuum emission by assuming the dust temperature of 20─100 K is 0.1─0.9 times the stellar mass, resulting in the Toomre Q parameter of 0.4─5. Hence, the disk structure may be partly unstable. All these results suggest that a rotationally supported disk can form in the earliest stages of the protostellar evolution.</td><td>2018</td><td>In star-formation studies, an important target is to understand when and how the rotationally supported disk is formed around the protostar. In order to address this question, we recently conducted the ALMA observations of the CCH (N=4-3) and H2CO (515-414 etc.) lines in Band 7 toward the low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398-3359 at a resolution of 0.&quot;5. We detected a beautiful outflow feature as well as a flattened envelope around the protostar. From the analysis of the outflow structure, the inclination angle of the envelope is estimated to be 10 degree (i.e. almost edge-on). Then, the velocity structure of the envelope is analyzed, and the mass of the protostar is roughly estimated to be as low as 0.02 Msun. Furthermore, the H2CO emission shows a sign of a Keplerian disk. These results will be an important clue to understanding the initial stage of disk formation processes, if confirmed. We here propose to observe the CCH (N=3-2) and H2CO (515-414 etc.) lines in the Band 6 and Band 7 at the resolution of 0.&quot;23 and 0.&quot;16, respectively. This observation will provide us with a deep insight into the initial stage of disk formation in Class 0 protostars.</td><td>IRAS1539_a_06_TE</td><td>Sakai, Nami; Bisschop, Suzanne; Lindberg, Johan; Jorgensen, Jes; Sakai, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshimasa; Hirota, Tomoya; van Dishoeck, Ewine; Yamamoto, Satoshi;</td><td>0.6384724367579291</td><td>0.06628670334624304</td><td>1.1417924</td><td>uid://A001/X13a/X164</td><td>uid://A001/X13a/X165</td><td>uid://A002/Xa5df2c/Xad7f</td><td>IRAS 15398-3359: Very Low Mass Class 0 Protostar?</td><td>S</td><td>TARGET</td><td>T</td><td>1.877064968909985</td><td>T</td><td>2018ApJ...864L..25O 2020ApJ...900...40O</td><td>Low-mass star formation, Astrochemistry</td><td>ISM and star formation</td><td>2020-12-09T18:36:19.744</td></tr>\n",

The outflow structure is mainly traced by the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 0 and 1), CCH, and CS emissions. These lines also trace the disk/envelope structure around the protostar. The H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 2 and 3), CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;OH, and SO emissions are concentrated toward the protostar, while the DCN emission is more extended around the protostar. We have performed principal component analysis (PCA) for these distributions on two different scales, the outflow and the disk/envelope structure. For the latter case, the molecular-line distributions are classified into two groups, according to the contribution of the second principal component, one having a compact distribution around the protostar and the other showing a rather extended distribution over the envelope. Moreover, the second principal component value tends to increase as an increasing quantum number of H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO (K&lt;SUB&gt;a&lt;/SUB&gt; = 0, 1, 2, and 3), reflecting the excitation condition: the distribution is more compact for higher excitation lines. These results indicate that PCA is effective at extracting the characteristic features of the molecular-line distributions around the protostar in an unbiased way. In addition, we identify four blobs in the outflow structure in the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO lines, some of which can also be seen in the CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;OH, CS, CCH, and SO emissions. The gas temperature derived from the H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO lines ranges from 43-63 K, which suggests shocks due to the local impact of the outflow on clumps of the ambient gas. We have observed the CCH (N = 3─2, J = 7/2─5/2, F = 4─3 and 3─2) and SO (6&lt;SUB&gt;7&lt;/SUB&gt;─5&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;) emission at a 0.″2 angular resolution toward the low-mass Class 0 protostellar source IRAS 15398─3359 with ALMA. The CCH emission traces the infalling-rotating envelope near the protostar with the outflow cavity extended along the northeast─southwest axis. On the other hand, the SO emission has a compact distribution around the protostar. The CCH emission is relatively weak at the continuum peak position, while the SO emission has a sharp peak there. Although the maximum velocity shift of the CCH emission is about 1 km s&lt;SUP&gt;−1&lt;/SUP&gt; from the systemic velocity, a velocity shift higher than 2 km s&lt;SUP&gt;−1&lt;/SUP&gt; is seen for the SO emission. This high-velocity component is most likely associated with the Keplerian rotation around the protostar. The protostellar mass is estimated to be {0.007}&lt;SUB&gt;-0.003&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;+0.004&lt;/SUP&gt; {M}&lt;SUB&gt;ȯ &lt;/SUB&gt; from the velocity profile of the SO emission. With this protostellar mass, the velocity structure of the CCH emission can be explained by the model of the infalling-rotating envelope, where the radius of the centrifugal barrier is estimated to be 40 au from the comparison with the model. The disk mass evaluated from the dust continuum emission by assuming the dust temperature of 20─100 K is 0.1─0.9 times the stellar mass, resulting in the Toomre Q parameter of 0.4─5. Hence, the disk structure may be partly unstable. All these results suggest that a rotationally supported disk can form in the earliest stages of the protostellar evolution.</td><td>2018</td><td>In star-formation studies, an important target is to understand when and how the rotationally supported disk is formed around the protostar. In order to address this question, we recently conducted the ALMA observations of the CCH (N=4-3) and H2CO (515-414 etc.) lines in Band 7 toward the low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398-3359 at a resolution of 0.&quot;5. We detected a beautiful outflow feature as well as a flattened envelope around the protostar. From the analysis of the outflow structure, the inclination angle of the envelope is estimated to be 10 degree (i.e. almost edge-on). Then, the velocity structure of the envelope is analyzed, and the mass of the protostar is roughly estimated to be as low as 0.02 Msun. Furthermore, the H2CO emission shows a sign of a Keplerian disk. These results will be an important clue to understanding the initial stage of disk formation processes, if confirmed. We here propose to observe the CCH (N=3-2) and H2CO (515-414 etc.) lines in the Band 6 and Band 7 at the resolution of 0.&quot;23 and 0.&quot;16, respectively.

Such changes in accretion, and related heating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical variations on different spatial scales and from source-to-source. We present images of emission from C17O, H13CO+, CH3OH, C34S and C2H toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359 on 0.&apos;&apos;5 (75 AU diameter) scales with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 340 GHz. The resolved images show that the emission from H13CO+ is only present in a ring-like structure with a radius of about 1-1.&apos;&apos;5 (150-200 AU) whereas the CO and other high dipole moment molecules are centrally condensed toward the location of the central protostar. We propose that HCO+ is destroyed by water vapor present on small scales. The origin of this water vapor is likely an accretion burst during the last 100-1000 yr increasing the luminosity of IRAS 15398-3359 by a factor of 100 above its current luminosity. Such a burst in luminosity can also explain the centrally condensed CH3OH and extended warm carbon-chain chemistry observed in this source and furthermore be reflected in the relative faintness of its compact continuum emission compared to other protostars. Subarcsecond (0.&apos;&apos;5) images of H2CO and CCH line emission have been obtained in the 0.8 mm band toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398–3359 in the Lupus 1 cloud as one of the Cycle 0 projects of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. We have detected a compact component concentrated in the vicinity of the protostar and a well-collimated outflow cavity extending along the northeast-southwest axis. The inclination angle of the outflow is found to be about 20°, or almost edge-on, based on the kinematic structure of the outflow cavity. This is in contrast to previous suggestions of a more pole-on geometry. The centrally concentrated component is interpreted by use of a model of the infalling rotating envelope with the estimated inclination angle and the mass of the protostar is estimated to be less than 0.09 M &amp;amp;#9737;. Higher spatial resolution data are needed to infer the presence of a rotationally supported disk for this source, hinted at by a weak high-velocity H2CO emission associated with the protostar.</td><td>2014</td><td>IRAS15398-3359 in the Lupus molecular cloud is a Class 0 protostar showing peculiar carbon chemistry. In this source, we have found that various carbon-chain molecules and their related molecules such as CCH, c-C3H2, and C4H are extremely abundant. Since these molecules are generally deficient in star forming regions, a similar source is very rare. Only exception known so far is L1527 in Taurus. In these two sources, carbon-chain molecules would be regenerated by evaporation of CH4 from grain mantles followed by subsequent gas-phase reactions(Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry: WCCC). We have observed carbon-chain molecules in L1527 with PdBI, and have found that their abundances are indeed enhanced in the CH4 evaporation region(20-30 K: 1000-2500 AU) around the protostar. Furthermore, the abundances decreases in the central 300-600 AU region, suggesting that they are partly destroyed and/or depleted in the innermost part. In order to establish the concept of the WCCC, it is indispensable to investigate the distributions of carbon-chain molecules in another WCCC source, IRAS15398-3359, at high resolution. Then, we here propose to observe CCH and other carbon-chain related species toward this source. Similarity and difference between the two WCCC sources provide us with important information on the origin and the mechanism of the WCCC. Now the WCCC is recognized as one of the extreme chemical nature of low-mass protostellar cores. The other extreme case is hot corino, characterized by rich existence of saturated complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and C2H5CN. Since the chemical composition of protostellar cores can be regarded as the initial condition for chemical evolution to protoplanetary disks, a thorough understanding of the WCCC through this observation is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry and related fields.</td><td>IRAS15398-3359 -3</td><td>Bisschop, Suzanne; Lindberg, Johan; Jorgensen, Jes; Sakai, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshimasa; Hirota, Tomoya; van Dishoeck, Ewine; Yamamoto, Satoshi;</td><td>2.0122438043511646</td><td>0.16177883065702608</td><td>1.1717557</td><td></td><td>uid://A001/X74/Xc4</td><td>uid://A002/X590461/Xda3</td><td>Imaging the Peculiar Carbon-Chain Chemistry of IRAS 15398-3359 in Lupus - 2</td><td>S</td><td>TARGET</td><td>T</td><td>6.076591861836499</td><td>T</td><td>2013ApJ...779L..22J 2014ApJ...795..152O</td><td>Astrochemistry, Low-mass star formation</td><td>ISM and star formation</td><td>2020-12-09T18:22:25.079</td></tr>\n",

In order to establish the concept of the WCCC, it is indispensable to investigate the distributions of carbon-chain molecules in another WCCC source, IRAS15398-3359, at high resolution. Then, we here propose to observe CCH and other carbon-chain related species toward this source. Similarity and difference between the two WCCC sources provide us with important information on the origin and the mechanism of the WCCC. Now the WCCC is recognized as one of the extreme chemical nature of low-mass protostellar cores. The other extreme case is hot corino, characterized by rich existence of saturated complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and C2H5CN. Since the chemical composition of protostellar cores can be regarded as the initial condition for chemical evolution to protoplanetary disks, a thorough understanding of the WCCC through this observation is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry and related fields.</td><td>IRAS15398-3359 -3</td><td>Bisschop, Suzanne; Lindberg, Johan; Jorgensen, Jes; Sakai, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshimasa; Hirota, Tomoya; van Dishoeck, Ewine; Yamamoto, Satoshi;</td><td>2.1273571194200764</td><td>0.16177883065702608</td><td>1.1717557</td><td></td><td>uid://A001/X74/Xc4</td><td>uid://A002/X590461/Xda3</td><td>Imaging the Peculiar Carbon-Chain Chemistry of IRAS 15398-3359 in Lupus - 2</td><td>S</td><td>TARGET</td><td>T</td><td>6.076591861836499</td><td>T</td><td>2013ApJ...779L..22J 2014ApJ...795..152O</td><td>Astrochemistry, Low-mass star formation</td><td>ISM and star formation</td><td>2020-12-09T18:22:25.079</td></tr>\n",

Such changes in accretion, and related heating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical variations on different spatial scales and from source-to-source. We present images of emission from C17O, H13CO+, CH3OH, C34S and C2H toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359 on 0.&apos;&apos;5 (75 AU diameter) scales with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 340 GHz. The resolved images show that the emission from H13CO+ is only present in a ring-like structure with a radius of about 1-1.&apos;&apos;5 (150-200 AU) whereas the CO and other high dipole moment molecules are centrally condensed toward the location of the central protostar. We propose that HCO+ is destroyed by water vapor present on small scales. The origin of this water vapor is likely an accretion burst during the last 100-1000 yr increasing the luminosity of IRAS 15398-3359 by a factor of 100 above its current luminosity. Such a burst in luminosity can also explain the centrally condensed CH3OH and extended warm carbon-chain chemistry observed in this source and furthermore be reflected in the relative faintness of its compact continuum emission compared to other protostars. Subarcsecond (0.&apos;&apos;5) images of H2CO and CCH line emission have been obtained in the 0.8 mm band toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398–3359 in the Lupus 1 cloud as one of the Cycle 0 projects of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. We have detected a compact component concentrated in the vicinity of the protostar and a well-collimated outflow cavity extending along the northeast-southwest axis. The inclination angle of the outflow is found to be about 20°, or almost edge-on, based on the kinematic structure of the outflow cavity. This is in contrast to previous suggestions of a more pole-on geometry. The centrally concentrated component is interpreted by use of a model of the infalling rotating envelope with the estimated inclination angle and the mass of the protostar is estimated to be less than 0.09 M &amp;amp;#9737;. Higher spatial resolution data are needed to infer the presence of a rotationally supported disk for this source, hinted at by a weak high-velocity H2CO emission associated with the protostar.</td><td>2014</td><td>IRAS15398-3359 in the Lupus molecular cloud is a Class 0 protostar showing peculiar carbon chemistry. In this source, we have found that various carbon-chain molecules and their related molecules such as CCH, c-C3H2, and C4H are extremely abundant. Since these molecules are generally deficient in star forming regions, a similar source is very rare. Only exception known so far is L1527 in Taurus. In these two sources, carbon-chain molecules would be regenerated by evaporation of CH4 from grain mantles followed by subsequent gas-phase reactions(Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry: WCCC).

Such changes in accretion, and related heating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical variations on different spatial scales and from source-to-source. We present images of emission from C17O, H13CO+, CH3OH, C34S and C2H toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359 on 0.&apos;&apos;5 (75 AU diameter) scales with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 340 GHz. The resolved images show that the emission from H13CO+ is only present in a ring-like structure with a radius of about 1-1.&apos;&apos;5 (150-200 AU) whereas the CO and other high dipole moment molecules are centrally condensed toward the location of the central protostar. We propose that HCO+ is destroyed by water vapor present on small scales. The origin of this water vapor is likely an accretion burst during the last 100-1000 yr increasing the luminosity of IRAS 15398-3359 by a factor of 100 above its current luminosity. Such a burst in luminosity can also explain the centrally condensed CH3OH and extended warm carbon-chain chemistry observed in this source and furthermore be reflected in the relative faintness of its compact continuum emission compared to other protostars. Subarcsecond (0.&apos;&apos;5) images of H2CO and CCH line emission have been obtained in the 0.8 mm band toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398–3359 in the Lupus 1 cloud as one of the Cycle 0 projects of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. We have detected a compact component concentrated in the vicinity of the protostar and a well-collimated outflow cavity extending along the northeast-southwest axis. The inclination angle of the outflow is found to be about 20°, or almost edge-on, based on the kinematic structure of the outflow cavity. This is in contrast to previous suggestions of a more pole-on geometry. The centrally concentrated component is interpreted by use of a model of the infalling rotating envelope with the estimated inclination angle and the mass of the protostar is estimated to be less than 0.09 M &amp;amp;#9737;. Higher spatial resolution data are needed to infer the presence of a rotationally supported disk for this source, hinted at by a weak high-velocity H2CO emission associated with the protostar.</td><td>2014</td><td>IRAS15398-3359 in the Lupus molecular cloud is a Class 0 protostar showing peculiar carbon chemistry. In this source, we have found that various carbon-chain molecules and their related molecules such as CCH, c-C3H2, and C4H are extremely abundant. Since these molecules are generally deficient in star forming regions, a similar source is very rare. Only exception known so far is L1527 in Taurus. In these two sources, carbon-chain molecules would be regenerated by evaporation of CH4 from grain mantles followed by subsequent gas-phase reactions(Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry: WCCC). We have observed carbon-chain molecules in L1527 with PdBI, and have found that their abundances are indeed enhanced in the CH4 evaporation region(20-30 K: 1000-2500 AU) around the protostar. Furthermore, the abundances decreases in the central 300-600 AU region, suggesting that they are partly destroyed and/or depleted in the innermost part. In order to establish the concept of the WCCC, it is indispensable to investigate the distributions of carbon-chain molecules in another WCCC source, IRAS15398-3359, at high resolution. Then, we here propose to observe CCH and other carbon-chain related species toward this source. Similarity and difference between the two WCCC sources provide us with important information on the origin and the mechanism of the WCCC. Now the WCCC is recognized as one of the extreme chemical nature of low-mass protostellar cores. The other extreme case is hot corino, characterized by rich existence of saturated complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and C2H5CN.
